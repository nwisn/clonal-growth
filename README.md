## About

This is a cellular automata model implemented in Mathematica, designed to simulate the expansion of clonal territories in a branching model of stem cell proliferation. A fluorescent imaging dataset was taken by Reza Ardehali's lab at UCLA to assess whether stem cell therapy was having an effect on regrowth of cardiac tissue, and the simulation model was designed to aid in inference of the parameters of the branching model, or a family of branching models.
